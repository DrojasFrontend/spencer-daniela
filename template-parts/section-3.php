        Daniela and I met way back in 2014 during the spring of our freshmen year in high school. We had both signed up for track and field, and we briefly interacted as we ran lap upon lap in the cold Colorado spring. We stayed in touch throughout the years of high school, remaining on friendly terms but never interacting more 
        than occasionally bumping into each other around school. After we both graduated, we went our separate ways. Years passed, and out of the blue, Daniela sent me a note on my 23rd birthday, wishing me well and seeing how I was doing. I was rather flattered that she had remembered my birthday after so many years, and we texted back and forth to catch up a bit.
